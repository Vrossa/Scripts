# Backup Silent Defense Script

This script is a very simple script to backup the various files, databases, and information within SilentDefense. There are probably better/more elegant ways to perform this backup so please feel free to contribute.

## What does it do?
This scripts stops all the SilentDefense services, copies the information over and restarts the services. If you are running this on a Sensor there will be changes that need to be made.
